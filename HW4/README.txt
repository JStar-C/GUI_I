Summary of Bootstrap Enhancements:
To be completely honest, I felt much more restricted while using Bootstrap
than CSS. Many of the so-called "enhancements" feel more like downgrades.
My favorite features were implemented using CSS like z-index layering,
sticky blocks, and an @media rule to control if the sidebar should scroll.
I used Bootstrap to simplfy the navbar, sidebar, and buttons. I used the
Bootstrap grid to make the main-text-body area dynamically line up with the
sidebar using different column lengths for different sized screens.
