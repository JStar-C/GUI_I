I will be using 2 of my HW Extension Tokens for this assignment

Sliders:
    the sliders seem to work perfectly, but the jQuery validation still does not work
    if the user enters numbers manually in the text field. I was told that my grade would
    not be negatively affected becuase of this from the previous HW.

Tabs:
    clicking the tab labeled, "+", will create a new tab and focus on it. the sliders work
    normally until more than one tab is open, in which case they semm to update the wrong tab
    numbers. I noticed that everytime I click "submit", a new nested div with class "table" is 
    created inside the table-placeholder. This cuases the table to duplicate without working 
    properly. I attempted to edit the tab labels, but doing so caused the inserting of tabs to 
    mess-up, I do not know why. I was going to add a checkbox input and an "X" to delete the tabs.
